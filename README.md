# federated_learning

Implemented federated learning on arduino devices.
- The Arduino Nano 33 BL devices are used.
- The main motive of federated learning is to address privacy concerns and solve the problem of data silos.
- We have implemented this approach for word recognition problem.
- Here, the entire training process is performed on the arduino device, which is a tiny ml device, with limited memory resources and CPU.
- A small-sized model is used, with the training data recorded from the device itself. 

Here, we found that more frequent rounds of federated learning is needed, as the training dataset recordings tend to be small in number
